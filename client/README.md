This project is going to be deployed on my scriptphi.com domain

scriptphi will essentially be the main website and will be a hub
for me to host smaller and less complex web ideas, really just
to host static project ideas, however of course they can each have
a server, but this project repo will only host client details, any
sub-website in this project may have a seperate backend on another
repo to accomplish more complex tasks

This client is using Vite React with Javascript, which should be fine
for something simple
